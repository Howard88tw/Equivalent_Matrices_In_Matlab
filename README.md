# Equivalent_Matrices_In_Matlab

Usage:
```
$ python generateAns.py
Please enter the matrix as MATLAB notation without any unnecessary space or commas. E.g. [3;5;6]
<< Enter your matrix in MATLAB syntax here! >>
```

Then an output file named "allPossibleAns.txt" will be generated with all equivalent syntax.

Suggestions are welcome : )
Also let me know if there's a bug
